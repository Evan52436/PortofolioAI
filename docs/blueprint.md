## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: The user requested '#83a3ca', which translates to a muted sky-blue tone. The mood should be peaceful and communicative.
- Background color: Very light tint of primary color, about 15% saturation: #E0E8EF
- Accent color: Deeper hue pulled slightly left (about 30 degrees), #6A87AC to hint towards indigo, and distinguish it visually from the primary color.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif; body font: 'Inter', sans-serif
- Use a mix of minimalist line icons and flat icons to represent skills, technologies, and project categories. Icons should be consistent in style.
- Employ a grid-based layout for showcasing projects and information in a structured manner. Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.
- Use subtle animations for transitions between sections and to highlight important elements on the page. Animation should be smooth and not distracting.
